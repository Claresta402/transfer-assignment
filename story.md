# Introduction to Git
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects efficiently and effectively. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git is designed to manage everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. One of its key features is its ability to track changes in source code, enabling teams to keep a historical record of modifications, collaborate without conflict, and revert to earlier versions when necessary. Unlike traditional version control systems, Git allows every user to have a complete local copy of the project repository, which enhances both performance and flexibility.
